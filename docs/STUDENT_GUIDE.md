## Getting Help from the AI Tutor

If you don't understand something, you can ask for help!

### How to Ask for Help

1. Click on **AI Tutor** or **Ask for Help**
2. Type your question, like:
   - "I don't understand fractions"
   - "How do I multiply big numbers?"

3. The AI Tutor will explain it to you!

### Tips for Asking Good Questions

✅ **Good questions:**
- "I don't understand why my answer was wrong"
- "Can you explain this in a different way?"
- "What's an easier way to solve this?"

❌ **Not so helpful:**
- "Just tell me the answer" (you won't learn this way!)
- "I hate maths" (the tutor can't help with this)

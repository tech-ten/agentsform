## The Problem

1. **Tutoring is expensive**: $50-100/hour, inaccessible for average families
2. **One-size-fits-all curriculum**: Schools can't personalise for each child
3. **Parents can't help**: Curriculum has changed; parents don't know how to teach new methods
4. **Screen time guilt**: Parents want educational screen time, not YouTube/games

## The Solution

An AI tutor that:
- Costs $5-12/month (not $200-400/month for human tutors)
- Adapts to each child's level in real-time
- Aligns perfectly with what they're learning at school
- Makes learning feel like a game, not homework

## Competitive Advantage

### 1. Curriculum-Specific Content
Unlike generic platforms (Khan Academy, IXL), our content maps directly to Victorian curriculum codes (VCMNA186, etc.). Parents can see exactly which school standards their child is mastering.

### 2. AI Cost Structure
We use Groq's free tier (LLaMA 3.3 70B) for AI tutoring - same quality as ChatGPT at zero marginal cost. Competitors pay $0.002-0.06 per AI request.

### 3. Australian Focus
- Australian English and examples
- Local curriculum alignment
- Sydney-hosted (data sovereignty)
- ACCC/Privacy Act compliant

### 4. Defensibility
- Curriculum content library (time-intensive to replicate)
- Learning data moat (improves recommendations over time)
- School relationships (once established, high switching costs)

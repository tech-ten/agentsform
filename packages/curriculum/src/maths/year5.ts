              content: `# Understanding Large Numbers

When we count beyond thousands, we enter the world of really big numbers! Let's explore how our place value system works with these large numbers.

## What is Place Value?

Every digit in a number has a special position that tells us its value. Think of it like assigned seats in a cinema - each seat has a specific spot!

| Hundred Thousands | Ten Thousands | Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Ones |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------|----------|------|------|
| 100,000          | 10,000        | 1,000     | 100      | 10   | 1    |

## Reading Large Numbers

Let's read the number **347,582**:
- **3** hundred thousands = 300,000
- **4** ten thousands = 40,000
- **7** thousands = 7,000
- **5** hundreds = 500
- **8** tens = 80
- **2** ones = 2

We say: "Three hundred and forty-seven thousand, five hundred and eighty-two"

## The Comma Rule

We use commas to separate groups of three digits from the right. This makes big numbers easier to read!

- 1,000 (one thousand)
- 10,000 (ten thousand)
- 100,000 (one hundred thousand)

## Ordering Large Numbers

When comparing large numbers, start from the left and compare digit by digit:

**Example:** Which is larger, 234,567 or 243,567?
- Both start with 2
- Next digit: 3 vs 4
- Since 4 > 3, we know **243,567 is larger**`,

Understanding factors and multiples helps us see how numbers are connected to each other!

## What are Factors?

**Factors** are numbers that divide evenly into another number with no remainder.

**Example:** What are the factors of 12?
- 1 × 12 = 12 ✓
- 2 × 6 = 12 ✓
- 3 × 4 = 12 ✓

So the factors of 12 are: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12**

### Finding Factors - The Pair Method

Start with 1 and work your way up, finding pairs:
- 1 and 12 (1 × 12 = 12)
- 2 and 6 (2 × 6 = 12)
- 3 and 4 (3 × 4 = 12)

Stop when your pairs start repeating!

## What are Multiples?

**Multiples** are what you get when you multiply a number by 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.

**Example:** Multiples of 5:
- 5 × 1 = 5
- 5 × 2 = 10
- 5 × 3 = 15
- 5 × 4 = 20

So multiples of 5 are: **5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30...**

## The Connection

Here's the cool part:
- If 3 is a **factor** of 12
- Then 12 is a **multiple** of 3

They're like two sides of the same coin!

## Common Factors and Multiples

**Common factors** are factors that two numbers share.
**Common multiples** are multiples that two numbers share.

**Example:** Common factors of 12 and 18:
- Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
- Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
- Common factors: **1, 2, 3, 6**`,

              content: `# Estimation and Rounding

Estimation is like making a smart guess! It helps us check if our answers make sense.

## Why Estimate?

Imagine you're buying items that cost $4.95, $3.10, and $7.85. Is $50 enough?

Instead of calculating exactly, we can estimate:
- $4.95 ≈ $5
- $3.10 ≈ $3
- $7.85 ≈ $8
- Total ≈ $5 + $3 + $8 = $16

Yes, $50 is plenty! 💰

## Rounding Rules

When rounding, look at the digit to the RIGHT of where you're rounding:

- **0, 1, 2, 3, 4** → Round DOWN
- **5, 6, 7, 8, 9** → Round UP

### Rounding to the Nearest 10
- 43 → **40** (3 is less than 5)
- 47 → **50** (7 is 5 or more)
- 45 → **50** (5 rounds up)

### Rounding to the Nearest 100
- 234 → **200** (3 is less than 5)
- 278 → **300** (7 is 5 or more)

### Rounding to the Nearest 1000
- 4,321 → **4,000** (3 is less than 5)
- 4,567 → **5,000** (5 is 5 or more)

## Using Estimation to Check Answers

**Example:** Is 387 × 4 = 1,548 reasonable?

Let's estimate:
- 387 ≈ 400
- 400 × 4 = 1,600

Since 1,548 is close to 1,600, the answer is reasonable! ✓

## Front-End Estimation

For quick estimates, just use the first digits:
- 487 + 312 ≈ 400 + 300 = 700
- Actual: 799 ✓ Close enough!`,

## The Standard Algorithm (Vertical Method)

This is the method your parents probably learned:

\`\`\`
    347
  ×   6
  -----
  2,082
\`\`\`

**Step by step:**
1. 6 × 7 = 42 (write 2, carry 4)
2. 6 × 4 = 24, plus 4 = 28 (write 8, carry 2)
3. 6 × 3 = 18, plus 2 = 20

## The Expanded Method (Partitioning)

Break the number into parts:

**347 × 6 = ?**
- 300 × 6 = 1,800

              content: `# Division with Remainders

Sometimes when we divide, things don't split evenly. That's where remainders come in!

## What is a Remainder?

When you share 17 lollies among 5 friends:
- Each friend gets 3 lollies (5 × 3 = 15)
- There are 2 lollies left over
- We write: **17 ÷ 5 = 3 remainder 2** or **17 ÷ 5 = 3 r 2**

## The Division Algorithm

\`\`\`
      32 r 1
   -------
 5 | 161
    -15    (5 × 30)
    ---
     11
    -10    (5 × 2)
    ---
      1    (remainder)
\`\`\`

**Check your work:** 5 × 32 + 1 = 160 + 1 = 161 ✓

## What Do Remainders Mean in Real Life?

The remainder's meaning depends on the situation:

**1. Ignore the remainder:**
"You have 23 eggs to fill cartons of 6. How many full cartons?"
- 23 ÷ 6 = 3 r 5
- Answer: **3 full cartons** (we ignore the 5 leftover eggs)

**2. Round up:**
"You need to transport 50 people in minibuses that hold 8 each. How many buses?"
- 50 ÷ 8 = 6 r 2
- Answer: **7 buses** (you can't leave 2 people behind!)

**3. The remainder IS the answer:**
"If you share 50 stickers among 8 friends, how many are left?"
- 50 ÷ 8 = 6 r 2
- Answer: **2 stickers left over**

## Division Strategies

### Using Multiplication Facts
- 56 ÷ 8 = ? → Think: 8 × ? = 56 → 8 × 7 = 56 → Answer: **7**

### Chunking
- 156 ÷ 6: First 156 - 120 (6×20) = 36, then 36 ÷ 6 = 6
- Answer: 20 + 6 = **26**`,

Fractions can be tricky to compare, but with the right strategies, it becomes much easier!

## Understanding Unit Fractions

A **unit fraction** has 1 as its numerator: ½, ⅓, ¼, ⅕, ⅙...

**Important rule:** The LARGER the denominator, the SMALLER the fraction!

Think about it: If you share a pizza among more people, each person gets a smaller piece.

- ½ of a pizza = large slice 🍕
- ⅛ of a pizza = tiny slice 🍕

So: **½ > ⅓ > ¼ > ⅕ > ⅙ > ⅐ > ⅛**

## Fractions on a Number Line

\`\`\`
0    ¼    ½    ¾    1
|----|----|----|----|
\`\`\`

Each fraction shows a position between 0 and 1.

## Comparing Fractions with Same Denominators

When denominators are the same, just compare numerators:

- ⅗ vs ⅖ → 3 > 2, so **⅗ > ⅖**
- ⁷⁄₁₀ vs ³⁄₁₀ → 7 > 3, so **⁷⁄₁₀ > ³⁄₁₀**

## Comparing Fractions with Same Numerators

When numerators are the same, the larger denominator means a smaller fraction:

- ³⁄₄ vs ³⁄₈ → 4 < 8, so **³⁄₄ > ³⁄₈**
- ²⁄₅ vs ²⁄₃ → 5 > 3, so **²⁄₅ < ²⁄₃**

## Using Benchmarks

Compare fractions to ½:
- Is ³⁄₈ more or less than ½? → ½ = ⁴⁄₈, and 3 < 4, so **³⁄₈ < ½**
- Is ⅝ more or less than ½? → ½ = ⁴⁄₈, and 5 > 4, so **⅝ > ½**`,

Decimals are another way to show parts of a whole number, just like fractions!

## Place Value in Decimals

The decimal point separates whole numbers from parts:

| Tens | Ones | . | Tenths | Hundredths | Thousandths |
|------|------|---|--------|------------|-------------|
| 10   | 1    | . | 0.1    | 0.01       | 0.001       |

**Example:** In 34.567:
- 3 tens = 30
- 4 ones = 4
- 5 tenths = 0.5
- 6 hundredths = 0.06
- 7 thousandths = 0.007

## Comparing Decimals

**Golden Rule:** Line up the decimal points, then compare from left to right!

**Example:** Which is larger, 3.45 or 3.5?

\`\`\`
3.45
3.50  (add a zero to help compare)
\`\`\`

Compare digit by digit:
- 3 = 3 ✓
- 4 < 5 ← Stop here!

So **3.5 > 3.45**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Wrong:** "3.45 is bigger because it has more digits"
✓ **Right:** Compare place values, not number of digits!

❌ **Wrong:** "0.5 is smaller than 0.42"
✓ **Right:** 0.5 = 0.50, and 50 > 42, so 0.5 > 0.42

## Decimals and Fractions Connection

| Fraction | Decimal |
|----------|---------|
| ½        | 0.5     |
| ¼        | 0.25    |
| ¾        | 0.75    |
| ⅕        | 0.2     |
| ⅒        | 0.1     |

## Ordering Decimals

To order decimals:
1. Line up decimal points
2. Add zeros to make same length
3. Compare from left to right

**Example:** Order 2.5, 2.35, 2.53

\`\`\`
2.50
2.35
2.53

Using the right unit makes measuring easier and more meaningful!

## Length Units

| Unit | Abbreviation | Used For |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Kilometres | km | Long distances (between cities) |
| Metres | m | Buildings, rooms, sports fields |
| Centimetres | cm | Books, pencils, body measurements |
| Millimetres | mm | Tiny things (thickness of paper) |

**Conversions:**
- 1 km = 1,000 m
- 1 m = 100 cm
- 1 cm = 10 mm

## Area Units

Area measures the space inside a 2D shape.

| Unit | Abbreviation | Used For |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Square kilometres | km² | Countries, regions |
| Square metres | m² | Rooms, gardens |
| Square centimetres | cm² | Book covers, photos |

## Volume and Capacity

**Volume** = space inside a 3D object
**Capacity** = how much liquid something holds

| Unit | Abbreviation | Used For |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Litres | L | Drinks, petrol |
| Millilitres | mL | Medicine, small amounts |
| Cubic centimetres | cm³ | Small 3D objects |
| Cubic metres | m³ | Rooms, swimming pools |

**Fun fact:** 1 mL = 1 cm³

## Mass

Mass tells us how heavy something is.

| Unit | Abbreviation | Used For |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Tonnes | t | Trucks, elephants |
| Kilograms | kg | People, groceries |
| Grams | g | Food ingredients |
| Milligrams | mg | Medicine |

**Conversions:**
- 1 t = 1,000 kg
- 1 kg = 1,000 g
- 1 g = 1,000 mg

## Choosing the Right Unit

Ask yourself: Will my answer be a sensible number?

❌ "The door is 2,100 mm tall" → Too many digits!
✓ "The door is 2.1 m tall" → Just right!

❌ "The ant weighs 0.002 kg" → Too small!
✓ "The ant weighs 2 mg" → Perfect!`,

              content: `# Perimeter, Area and Volume

These three measurements tell us different things about shapes!

## Perimeter

**Perimeter** = the distance around the outside of a shape

For a rectangle:
\`\`\`
Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)
or
Perimeter = length + width + length + width
\`\`\`

**Example:** A rectangle 8m by 5m
- Perimeter = 2 × (8 + 5) = 2 × 13 = **26 metres**

## Area

**Area** = the space inside a 2D shape (measured in square units)

For a rectangle:
\`\`\`
Area = length × width
\`\`\`

**Example:** A rectangle 8m by 5m
- Area = 8 × 5 = **40 square metres (40 m²)**

### Visualising Area

Think of covering the floor with 1m × 1m tiles:
\`\`\`
┌─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┐
├─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┤
├─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┤
├─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┤
├─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┤
└─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┘
8 across × 5 down = 40 squares
\`\`\`

## Volume

**Volume** = the space inside a 3D shape (measured in cubic units)

For a rectangular prism (box):
\`\`\`
Volume = length × width × height
\`\`\`

**Example:** A box 4cm × 3cm × 2cm
- Volume = 4 × 3 × 2 = **24 cubic centimetres (24 cm³)**

### Volume and Capacity

For rectangular containers:
- **1 cm³ = 1 mL**
- **1,000 cm³ = 1 L**

So a container 10cm × 10cm × 10cm:
- Volume = 1,000 cm³ = **1 litre**

              content: `# Understanding Angles

An angle is formed when two lines meet at a point. We measure angles in degrees (°).

## Types of Angles

### Acute Angle (Sharp!)
- Less than 90°
- Think: "a-CUTE little angle"
- Examples: 30°, 45°, 60°, 85°

### Right Angle (Square corner)
- Exactly 90°
- Makes an "L" shape
- Found in corners of books, doors, screens

### Obtuse Angle (Wide)
- Between 90° and 180°
- Think: "ob-TUSE is ob-BIG"
- Examples: 100°, 120°, 150°

### Straight Angle
- Exactly 180°
- Forms a straight line

### Reflex Angle
- Between 180° and 360°
- More than a straight angle
- Examples: 200°, 270°, 350°

## Estimating Angles

Use benchmarks to estimate:
- 45° = half of a right angle
- 90° = right angle (corner of a page)
- 180° = straight line
- 360° = full turn

## Using a Protractor

A protractor is a tool for measuring angles:

1. Place the centre point on the angle's vertex (corner)
2. Line up the baseline with one arm of the angle
3. Read the scale where the other arm crosses
4. Use the correct scale! (inside or outside)

**Tip:** If the angle looks less than 90°, your answer should be less than 90°!

## Angles in Shapes

| Shape | Sum of Angles |
|-------|---------------|
| Triangle | 180° |
| Quadrilateral | 360° |
| Pentagon | 540° |

## Angles Around a Point

All angles around a point add up to 360° (a full rotation).`,

              content: `# Understanding Probability

Probability tells us how likely something is to happen.

## The Probability Scale

Probability is measured from 0 to 1:

\`\`\`
Impossible ←————————————————————→ Certain
    0        ¼        ½        ¾        1
\`\`\`

- **0** = Impossible (will never happen)
- **½** = Even chance (equally likely to happen or not)
- **1** = Certain (will definitely happen)

## Writing Probability as Fractions

\`\`\`
Probability = Number of ways event can happen
              ─────────────────────────────────
              Total number of possible outcomes
\`\`\`

## Example: Rolling a Die

A standard die has 6 faces: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

**What is the probability of rolling a 4?**
- Ways to get a 4: 1 (only one face shows 4)
- Total outcomes: 6 (six faces)
- Probability = 1/6

**What is the probability of rolling an even number?**
- Even numbers on die: 2, 4, 6 (3 ways)
- Total outcomes: 6
- Probability = 3/6 = 1/2

## Example: Picking from a Bag

A bag has 2 red, 3 blue, and 5 green marbles (10 total).

**P(red) = 2/10 = 1/5**
**P(blue) = 3/10**
**P(green) = 5/10 = 1/2**

## Listing All Outcomes

For a coin flip: {Heads, Tails} → 2 outcomes

For rolling a die: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} → 6 outcomes

For two coin flips: {HH, HT, TH, TT} → 4 outcomes

## Key Facts

- All probabilities are between 0 and 1
- Probabilities of all outcomes add up to 1
- More ways an event can happen → higher probability`,

              content: `# Displaying Data

Data displays help us see patterns and understand information quickly!

## Types of Data

**Categorical data** = data in categories (colours, pets, favourite foods)
**Numerical data** = data as numbers (ages, heights, scores)

## Column Graphs (Bar Graphs)

Best for: Comparing categories

### How to make a column graph:
1. Draw axes (horizontal and vertical)
2. Label the horizontal axis with categories
3. Label the vertical axis with numbers (scale)
4. Draw columns for each category
5. Make all columns the same width
6. Leave equal gaps between columns
7. Add a title!

**Example: Favourite Sports**
\`\`\`
Number of students
     │
  10 │    ██
   8 │    ██      ██
   6 │    ██  ██  ██
   4 │ ██ ██  ██  ██  ██
   2 │ ██ ██  ██  ██  ██
   0 └─────────────────────
       Cricket Soccer Tennis Basketball
\`\`\`

## Dot Plots

Best for: Showing how data is spread

### How to make a dot plot:
1. Draw a number line
2. Put a dot above each number for each piece of data
3. Stack dots when values repeat

**Example: Test Scores**
\`\`\`
        •
        •     •
    •   •   • •
    •   •   • •   •
────────────────────
    5   6   7   8   9
\`\`\`

## Two-Way Tables

Best for: Showing two categories at once

**Example: Pets by Year Level**
| | Dogs | Cats | Fish |
|---|---|---|---|
| Year 4 | 8 | 5 | 3 |
| Year 5 | 10 | 7 | 4 |
| Year 6 | 6 | 9 | 5 |
